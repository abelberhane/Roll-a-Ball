# Roll-a-Ball
Unity 3d Game

This game was built using Unity and C#. 

The project is split into 3 separate files, one for the player, one for the camera and one for the rotator. The physics behind this was complex but the internet was a great tool. I added comments after every code block to help break that down. 

If there are any pointers please feel free to let me know. Understanding this process was a bit more complex but I enjoyed the final much more.
